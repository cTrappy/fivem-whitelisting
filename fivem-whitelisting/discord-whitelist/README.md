### Discord Whitelist

Made by https://dsc.gg/bribe



## What is this?
This is a rescource that lets you whitelist/blacklist on your FiveM server for Discord!
For example you can have a banned role on your Discord, then you configure the settings
and that role can not join the server!


## Why did you make this?
To make whitelisting and blacklisting a whole lot easier since most FiveM servers use
Discord, this will also make it so there is no need for whitelisting/blacklisting ips.
